##Airtel Customer Churn Analysis (ChurnQuest)
## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes customer churn for a telecommunications company (Airtel scenario) using Excel-based data analysis. The goal was to identify key behavioral, pricing, and service-related factors that influence customer churn and provide actionable retention strategies.

## 🎯 Business Problem

Airtel observed an increase in customer churn, which threatens revenue and market share.
This project explores customer usage, plans, pricing, and service interactions to uncover why customers leave and how to reduce churn.

## 📂 Dataset

Source: Kaggle – Customer Churn Prediction Dataset
Customers analyzed: 4,250

## Key data includes:

Call usage (day, evening, night, international)

Service plans (International & Voice Mail)

Customer service interactions

Billing and tenure information

## 🛠 Tools & Techniques

Microsoft Excel

Pivot Tables & Pivot Charts

Descriptive statistics

Correlation analysis

Segmentation & bucketing (feature engineering)

## 🔎 Feature Engineering

New analytical columns created:

NoOfCall_bucket → Service call threshold analysis

intl_charge_bucket → Pricing sensitivity analysis

vmail_message_bucket → Feature engagement analysis

## 📊 Key Insights

Churn rate: 14.1% (1 in 7 customers leave)

Customers with 4+ service calls → 50% churn

International plan users → 42% churn

Heavy daytime users churn due to higher charges (bill shock)

Voice mail users churn less → value-added features improve retention

Pricing dissatisfaction is a bigger churn driver than usage volume

##💡 Business Recommendations

Trigger retention actions after 3 service calls

Redesign international plan pricing

Offer usage-based calling plans

Improve billing transparency

Promote value-added services like voicemail

## 📈 Outcome

The project demonstrates how behavioral and pricing insights can help telecom companies design data-driven retention strategies and reduce revenue loss from churn.
